This paper is a survey of procedural generation algorithms, used to create believable virtual worlds. Some simulations that can be used to enhance results are discussed as well. An infinite terrain generation software solution, developed in Unity Engine from the ground up, is also presented, with detailed steps and screenshots to better visualize the proposed methods. Due to the fact that optimization plays a great role in the success of an application, some interesting ways of improving the performance of such software are discussed, with the key elements highlighted.\\
